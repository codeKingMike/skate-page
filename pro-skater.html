				<h2>Famous Skate Legends</h2>
				<h3>Rodney Mullen</h3>
				<p>In mid-2012, Ben Harper and I were driving to a premiere of the Bones Brigade Documentary, when Dhani Harrison called. Ben put him on speaker to introduce us, because Dhani had been on him about this idea of having me skate in a special camera system created by Steven Sebring. I immediately found myself a little star-struck in listening to him, but Dhani quickly had me laughing and intrigued by ideas and pure love for skating. A couple of weeks later, I found myself in Dhani’s office, completely taken-in by the scope of his vision. It was there that he introduced me to his manager David Zonshine, who has an x-ray-vision kind of insight in his ability to capture essences and connect them. Together, they are a formidable pair. Having used Steven’s Dome to photograph his father’s guitar collection, Dhani said he’d like to get me in there before moving on to other legendary guitar collections from musicians that made my head spin. I apologetically explained that I had not filmed in years, still in the throes of trying to break apart the adhesions that had fused my right femur to my hip—fueled by hope, yet without promise. Dhani never even winced; he merely stated that it’d be ready for me whenever I was, then went into detail about Sebring’s revolutionary invention. He’d periodical pause to hop onto his board and snap a quick heelflip—as if to complete his thought—then warned that there was nothing that could prepare me to skate in Steven’s Dome.</p>

				<p>A few months later, I met Steven in the Bowery Hotel lobby, a day or two before we tested the rig for the first time. Steven Sebring is one of the most respected photographers in the world, having shot many of the most iconic figures in music, fashion, and more; beyond that, he’s a visionary. Steven is a tall, long-haired, black-clad figure with a penetrating gaze, yet the moment I met him, his smiling candor overcame his natural gravitas. As soon as we shared ideas, an almost childlike excitement overcame him. It was then that I realized we tapped into the core of his love for leveraging technology to capture movement in unparalleled ways, utilizing what he stressed was Pure Photography. This was my first glimpse into his genius.
				This collaboration of Dhani Harrison, Steven Sebring and myself was driven simply by a love of what we do. There were no sponsors, nor will there be any product launch. While there was indeed talk of app’s at first, it was all scrapped because we didn’t want constraints or deadlines to bind us. Together, along with Steven’s band of digital wizards, we single-mindedly committed ourselves to creating something pure and beautiful, by doing what we do. Together, we leveraged and redlined everything we’ve done for most of our lives, all that makes us who we are. We hope that you enjoy this.

				<h3>Tony Hawk</h3>
				<p>Skateboarding’s most recognisable name. Putting his name onto one of video games biggest franchises ever, setting up a massively successful skateboard empire and building skateparks all over the world to make sure skateboard lives on for years to come. It was his skateboarding that launched him onto the scene, being the first to ever land a televised 900 in 1999 and being voted skater of the year by Thrasher Magazine in 1990. Tony Hawk, to this day, continues to be an ambassador for the sport of Skateboarding. Anthony Frank "Tony" Hawk (born May 12, 1968), commonly known by his nickname "The Birdman", is an American professional skateboarder, actor, and owner of skateboard company Birdhouse. Hawk is well known for completing the first documented 900 and for his licensed video game titles, published by Activision. He is widely considered to be one of the most successful and influential pioneers of modern vertical skateboarding.</p>

				<p>In 2002, he created the "Boom Boom HuckJam", an extreme sports exhibition and tour that was launched in Las Vegas. Throughout his career, Hawk has made numerous appearances in films, other media, and his own series of video games. He has also been involved in various philanthropic activities, including his own Tony Hawk Foundation that helps to build skateparks in underprivileged areas. In 2014, Hawk was named one of the most influential skateboarders of all time by FoxWeekly. Tony Hawk was born on May 12, 1968 in Carlsbad, California, to Nancy and Frank Peter Rupert Hawk, and was raised in San Diego, California. When Hawk was young, he was described as being "hyperactive," and his mother says that he was "so hard on himself and expected himself to do so many things." One time, Hawk struck out in baseball and was so distraught that he hid in a ravine and had to be "physically coaxed out" by his father. His frustration with himself was so harsh that his parents had him psychologically evaluated at school. The results were that Tony was "gifted," he tested with an I.Q. of 144, and school advisers recommended placing him in advanced classes.</p>

				<h2>Bob Burnquist</h2>
				<p>An X Games legend, Bob has the most medals in the event's history, with 30. As of Austin 2016, he'll be the only person to compete at every X Games summer event. The 40-year-old defending Big Air champ is still going strong, contesting Vert and Big Air. He opened up his backyard playground to other skaters, but don't count on the field gaining on him in Big Air: He owns 8 gold in the discipline. Bob is building the first vert ramp ever in his hometown of Rio de Janeiro and loves to fly, including fixed wing, helicopters and now drones. His two daughters are on two continents, and he splits his time between the two. "Lots of tricks go down in my backyard that are never going to happen at X Games," says Burnquist. "That's for video progression and that's always where the real technical progression will be. Backyard skateboarding has no constraints in the creativity."</p>

				<p>Bob Burnquist's specialties are in switch stance skateboarding, and in creating innovative vert tricks. Burnquist has always tried to find new ways to make his tricks more creative, and more difficult. Burnquist has a signature trick called the "One-footed Smith grind".

				In 2000, Burnquist won the X Games' best trick contest, with his famous Fakie 5-0 with a fakie kickflip off of the grind bar.

				Burnquist's biggest success to date came in the vert contest at the 2001 X Games. Prior to his final run (the last run of the event), Burnquist was sitting in second place behind two-time defending champion, Bucky Lasek. Burnquist produced a flawless run, including multiple tricks that had never been seen before and, as a result, were unnamed. During the run, commentator Tony Hawk went hoarse and nearly lost his voice while screaming in disbelief. Burnquist was rewarded with a score of 98 out of 100, the second highest score ever given in any X Games skateboarding event, behind only Bucky Lasek's score of a 98.50 the year before. Burnquist won a gold medal in the 2005 X Games Best Trick vert contest, placing fourth in the Vert section, and sixth in the Big Air contest.</p>
